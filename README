oicb is a minimalistic replacement for icb[1] command-line client.  oicb lacks
many (insecure) features, but offers one big advantage: screen is not blocked
while you're typing.

The code is under 2-clause BSD license, see the LICENSE file.

Building instructions:

OpenBSD: simple "make" should suffice, although you may want run "make obj" first.

Generic way: usual CMake-based build: "mkdir -p build && cd build && cmake .. && make".
You'll need libreadline-dev and libncurses-dev installed.
On non-BSD systems you'll need libbsd-dev as well.

Things I'm willing to have but too lazy to do myself now:

  * Start using <stdbool.h>.
  * Implement /query as /w wrapper.
  * Take care of /g and /name (update 'room' and 'nick').
  * Implement /beep (send beep character to console).
  * Nicer group list formatting.
